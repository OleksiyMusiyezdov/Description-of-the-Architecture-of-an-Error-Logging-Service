Task: Describe the Architecture of an Error Logging Service
Overview
You need to prepare a document describing how you would design an error logging service from scratch. Explain which technologies you would choose for the client library (SDK), backend API, database, web dashboard, and DevOps solution, and justify why these choices are optimal. 
Functional Requirements:
Client SDK that developers integrate into their applications to capture and send error logs.
API Backend that receives, processes, and stores logs from client applications.
Web Dashboard for developers to view, search, and analyze logged errors.
Real-time Alerts via email notifications on critical errors.
DevOps solution for scalable deployment, monitoring, and log storage optimization.
-----

Solution:

1. Client SDK - a bunch of functions to interact with the service.

It should capture errors, add context (user ID, session, environment, etc), and send this to the backend. 

It should be implemented in the native language(s) of each supported platform.
It should be integrated with the platform-specific error handling mechanisms.
It should send logs via a shared REST or gRPC API, use HTTPS with retry logic and batching.

2. API Backend

API Gateway can be used (authentication, routing, rate limiting, load balancer, etc).

API Backend should authenticate the source of the query. It can be implemented with JWT-based API keys per client because it seems secure and relatively simple authentication.

It should receive queries, send logs to storages, send data to the Web Dashboard. A quite widespread approach is to use Node.js (with Express, or Fastify, or Nest).

It should implement alerts/notifications. Usually message brokers are used for this aim (for example, Kafka seems to be scalable).

3. Web Dashboard

Can be easily written in React.js (easier than Angular, for example) + TypeScript (adds reliability to the pure JavaScript by implementing types check) + TailwindCSS (simplifies work with CSS) + Chart.js (for example).

4. Real-time Alerts via email notifications on critical errors.

Can be based on Kafka or AWS lambdas and use email sending services (like SendGrid) and integrations with third-party services via webhooks.

5. DevOps solution

Run service (dockers, kubernetes).
CI/CD (like GitHub Actions or similar staff including testing for example) I believe that AWS, GCP or Azure decisions are quite similar in this relation. AWS is more widespread.
Monitor running service (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog).

Additionally:

6. Data storage to store error logs and metadata and support efficient search and archiving

Technologies:
Elasticsearch for logs (quick access, sorting and filtration)
PostgreSQL for relational data
Redis for caching
S3 Bucket for long-term archivation

Justification:

All mentioned technologies are widely used in the market to satisfy needs they were developed for. So it witnesses at least their reliability and possibilities for support.
Additional Task: Developer Questions for the Platform Owner
As a developer, formulate key questions for the platform owner to clarify requirements and expectations.
-----
Questions:
What types of logs are needed? (errors, warnings, events) 	
Expected daily log volume? 	
Which platforms should the SDK support? 	
Batch or real-time logging? 	
Should logs be searchable by tags, stack traces, device info?
Default log retention period? Paid archive option?
Preferred cloud provider or deployment model?
Do you need integrations with third-party tools (Slack, Jira, etc.)?
